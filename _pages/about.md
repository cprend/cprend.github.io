I am an [NSF Office of Polar Programs Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.nsf.gov/geo/opp/postdoc_awardees.jsp) with James Girton at the University of Washington--Applied Physics Laboratory. Prior to that I was a [NOAA Climate and Global Change Postdoctoral Fellow](https://cpaess.ucar.edu/cgc) with Andy Thompson at California Institute of Technology and Georgy Manucharyan at University of Washington. I received a Ph.D. in physical oceanography from Scripps Institution of Oceanography working with Lynne Talley and Sarah Gille as part of the [Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling project](https://soccom.princeton.edu/). In 2025, I will move to the University of Edinburgh as a faculty member in the School of GeoSciences. 

Research interests
======
I am interested in a wide range of topics related to Southern Ocean dynamics, including ice-ocean interactions, air-sea fluxes, and physical controls on biogeochemistry. 

Outreach
======
I am very passionate about communicating climate science to the general public. As an undergraduate, I interned at the NYC Mayor's Office of Climate and Sustainability helping design public education campaigns related to climate change and energy efficiency as part of the [GreeNYC program](https://www.nyc.gov/site/sustainability/onenyc/greenyc.page). I also served as content manager for a pop science blog called the Columbia Science Review and have written for several publications aimed at general audiences including [Oceanbites](https://oceanbites.org/author/cprend/) and [SOCCOM at Sea](https://soccomatsea.blogspot.com/2020/03/musings-from-rv-ron-brown-march-april.html). I have served as a scientific advisor on climate issues to state and federal legislators, and was a member of the 2019 cohort of American Geophysical Union [Voices for Science Advocates](https://www.agu.org/honors/voices-for-science).
