I'm a climate scientist and Lecturer (~Assistant Professor) at University of Edinburgh in the School of GeoSciences. Prior to that, I was an [NSF Office of Polar Programs Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.nsf.gov/geo/opp/postdoc_awardees.jsp) with James Girton at the University of Washington--Applied Physics Laboratory, and a [NOAA Climate and Global Change Postdoctoral Fellow](https://cpaess.ucar.edu/cgc) with Andy Thompson at California Institute of Technology and Georgy Manucharyan at University of Washington. I received a Ph.D. in physical oceanography from Scripps Institution of Oceanography working with Lynne Talley and Sarah Gille as part of the [Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling project](https://soccom.princeton.edu/).

Research interests
======
The goal of my research, broadly speaking, is to understand the impact of the polar oceans on global climate. My background is in physical oceanography, but I work on a range of interdisciplinary topics including ice-ocean interactions, air-sea fluxes, and physical controls on marine biogeochemistry. Much of my research leverages new autonomous observations from the Southern Ocean collected by profiling floats, gliders, wave buoys, and instrumented marine mammals. However, I often use satellite data, theory, and numerical models to interpret these measurements. I believe that a diverse set of tools is necessary to make progress on complex and multi-scale problems related to the ocean's role in the climate system.

Outreach
======
I'm very passionate about communicating climate science to the general public. As an undergraduate, I interned at the NYC Mayor's Office of Climate and Sustainability helping design public education campaigns related to climate change and energy efficiency as part of the [GreeNYC program](https://www.nyc.gov/site/sustainability/onenyc/greenyc.page). I was also the content manager for a pop science blog called the [Columbia Science Review](https://www.thecolumbiasciencereview.com/) and have written for several publications aimed at general audiences including [Oceanbites](https://oceanbites.org/author/cprend/) and [SOCCOM at Sea](https://soccomatsea.blogspot.com/2020/03/musings-from-rv-ron-brown-march-april.html). I have served as a scientific advisor on climate issues to state and federal legislators, and was a member of the 2019 cohort of American Geophysical Union [Voices for Science Advocates](https://www.agu.org/honors/voices-for-science).
