I am an [NSF Office of Polar Programs Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.nsf.gov/geo/opp/postdoc_awardees.jsp) with James Girton at the University of Washington--Applied Physics Laboratory. Prior to that I was a [NOAA Climate and Global Change Postdoctoral Fellow](https://cpaess.ucar.edu/cgc) with Andy Thompson at California Institute of Technology and Georgy Manucharyan at University of Washington. I received a Ph.D. in Physical Oceanography from Scripps Institution of Oceanography working with Lynne Talley and Sarah Gille as part of the [Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling project](https://soccom.princeton.edu/). In 2025, I will move to the University of Edinburgh as a faculty member in the School of GeoSciences.
